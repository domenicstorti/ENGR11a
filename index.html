In ostomy patients, tangled or kinked drainage tubes are a recurring issue that cause fluid backup and can lead to symptoms such as nausea and vomiting which may hinder the recovery process. For recovering patients who spend much of the day in bed, a solution is desperately needed. </p></div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4 me-auto"><p class="lead">As of now, it does not appear that many effective solutions for this issue have been proposed. One solution, according to the Enterostomal Therapy Centre in Victoria, B.C. is to prevent drainage tubing kinking "by threading it through your pajama pant leg"(Elder et al., 2018), which is not a surefire fix. Because of the apparent lack of attention to this problem, our group has dedicated our final project to creating an open-source solution to assist ostomy patients and prevent tube backflow.   </p></div>

The model was packaged as an STL file and opened in the PrusaSlicer software. First, the Prusa MINI + Input Shaper configuration was selected (since these printers are the available hardware) and then the infill percentage was adjusted to 20%. Finally, the STL file was sliced and exported to a USB storage device as G-code. The STL file was then saved as a 3MF file; 3MF files generally take up less storage than STL files and can store adjusted printer settings. </p>

The filament color was changed about halfway through the print for the border and text once the base was printed, as was inicated in the G-code file. The skirt appears crooked in the image, but this is because I accidentally bumped it while trying to photograph the results. Oops!</p>

I selected a calibration print file from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5519406 in 3MF format. Since this file was in 3MF format, many of the print settings were already pre-selected. Despite this, I scaled the size of the model down to 50%. This was for two reasons: to save time and to make the intricate parts of the model more difficult to print. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4 text-secondary">This was the result of the first stress test print. The overhang section of the model seemingly printed without issue. This is likely because the overhangs were supported by many beams at different angles. However, both the cones/pillars and text experienced printing issues. Three of the four cones had snapped at the top and there was a significant amount of stringing between them. The other pillars had also snapped out of place and much of the text was illegible. These observations suggest that intricate details such as these should be printed at a larger scale to avoid error. </p>

I found a set of three models of the Totodile Pokémon evolution line from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5529452. I selected this model because there were many small details and overhangs that required supports, which I had hoped would really challenge the printer. Before I could begin printing, I had to convert the downloaded STL file into a 3MF file because the STL file was too large. </p>

The aim of this design was to save time during printing and make it easier to swap out filament colors. I began by drawing a rough sketch of what the design would look like with both components combined. With this design, the biggest challenege I anticipated was effectively printing these designs within the bounds of the printing bed. </p>

I created two brackets on the snip holder using rectangular prisms and joined them together as a single object. The purpose of the brackets was to allow the snip holder to attach and detach from the spool holder frame. All of this proceeded successfully, but as can be seen in the picture above, the two models did not fully fit within the print bed. The two models were found here:

                                    <p class="mb-4 text-secondary">After, I exported the model to PrusaSlicer as an STL file. In order to fit both models on the print bed, I had to rotate the snip holder by 45 degrees. Finally, I generated organic supports to stabilize the models as they printed and exported the files as G-code to begin the print. The print lasted around 7 hours with much of the time allocated towards printing the supports and infill.   </p>

To my surprise, it had turned out exactly as I had expected and it was able to hold both a filament spool and snips. If I had more time, I would've used my newfound TinkerCAD knowledge to design a more nuanced bracket system that could secure the snip holder more strongly to the spool holder. I also learned how capable PrusaMINI printers are at printing large objects. </p>

I found STL files for a model of a mountain range and a model of the Pokémon Groudon and imported them into Fusion360 as polygon meshes. Next, I used Fusion360 to convert the meshes into 3D models and joined the two models together into a single object. The two models were found here:

                                    <p class="mb-4 text-secondary">The final model was then exported as a new STL file and opened in PrusaSlicer. I had thought that the model would be too large, but at 100% scale the model fit the print bed perfectly. I chose to generate organic supports to stabilize the Groudon model, but they stemmed directly from the moutain terrain and I was worried that this might affect the print quality. Despite this, I couldn't find another time efficient way to proceed and decided to export the model into G-code anyway. The printed lasted for about 6 hours. </p>

The supports that were connected to the hands were stronger than I had anticipated and they ended up snapping off part of each arm when they were removed. However, my goals of overall looking cooler and ensuring that the figure stood upright were both achieved. If I had more time, I would've spent longer in Fusion360 finding a more appropriate location to place the figure and I would've spent more time in PrusaSlicer to generate thinner support structures. This print had provided me with valuable knowledge and I will adjust my approach in the future. </p>

In order to begin designing the containers, the dimensions of the circuit board and the battery compartment had to be measured. Using calipers, the dimensions of the battery box in millimeters were 57.34 x 45.80 x 13.63 and the dimensions of the circuit board in millimeters were 64.61 x 26.0. The height of the circuit board was not measured because it was planned to be exposed. </p>

The measurments were incorporated into the design with an extra millimeter added so that the battery pack and circuit board would be able to fit snugly. Two seperate designs were considered for the laser cut box, but ultimately the one on the bottom was chosen due to time constraints. </p>

After I had a rough outline modeled using the sketch and extrude features, I downloaded the model as an STL file and opened it in TinkerCad. In TinkerCad, I constructed the pegs on the bottom section of the box using cylindrical shapes. After this, I made of copy of one cylinder and increased the diameter by 0.5 millimeters to make the holes for the pegs to fit using the hole tool. Finally, I imported the updated STL file back into Fusion360 to ensure the measurments were correct. Fusion360 added many lines to the faces of the container model (as seen above) but thankfully this didn't affect the model or measurements.  </p>

Thankfully, the container's design was very 3D printer friendly and it did not require any supports to print. After exporting the file as G-code and initiating, the print had a total runtime of 2 hours and 4 minutes with a majority of the time dedicated to printing the 15% infill. As this print proceeded, I decided to start two additional prints of the same container with slightly altered variables. </p>

The two altered containers are the one printed in blue filament at 120% scale and the one printed in multicolor filament printed at 85% scale. The 120% scale container was a bit large but it was able to successfully contain the circuit board and battery pack with extra space. The 85% scale container was printed smaller to save filament, but the dimensions of the circuit hole and battery compartment were kept the same as the white filament while the size of the pegs and peg holes were increased to improve stability. </p>

Above, the functioning circuit inside of the container is pictured. While I consider this a successful design process, if I had more time I would've liked to make additional improvements to the peg securing system so that the container could be opened more easily. </p>

The design that was selected was a large wooden box that would be able to house the smaller 3D printed container. In Fusion360, I began by following the tutorial provided to us in class to create a box design that was compatable with the CNC machine. After I finished modeling this box, I adjusted the dimenstions in Fusion360 so that they would be appropriate for their intended purpose. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">After the container was completely modeled, each face was exported as a DXF file and opened in the LightBurn application as pictured above. For some reason, the faces imported into LightBurn appeared larger than they should have been so I tried my best to resize them using the LightBurn toolbar. After this was complete, the faces were saved as a single DXF file and were exported for use in the CNC laser cut machine with plywood as the material.    </p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">The laser cut process only took about two minutes to complete after replacing the plywood and initializing the machine. However, the resizing changes did not carry over to the machine even after they were saved and uploaded, so the pieces ended up printing much larger. The container was then assembled by using hot glue as an adhesive.     </p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">Finally, the laser cut box was fully assembled. Although it was too large, it was able to comfortably fit the 3D printed container rotated sideways which is shown above. Unfortunately a second correctly sized iteration of the laser cut container was not able to be constructed due to the time constraints of the project. However, I am now confident in my abilities to design and produce a second successful iteration using the knowledge I acquired from using the LightBurn software and laser cut machine. If I had more time to work on this project, I would have attempted to design and manufacture either an improved and appropriately sized version of the above container, or I would have tried the other design in the preliminary sketch. Overall I am satisfied with the results of this project and I look forward to integrating these new skills into future projects.  </p>

First, the STL files of the components for the prosthetic were downloaded and imported into the IdeaMaker slicer.

With these paramters, it was estimated that the print would take around 33 hours to complete.  </p>

First, as pictured above, the initial attempt to print the prosthetic components had failed around 16 hours into the print. Because of this, we decided to outsource the printing of some of the smaller components such as the fingers, knuckles, and pins to the Prusa mini printers which had a shorter printing time and were easier to monitor and restart given a failure.  </p>

Thankfully we were able to print the final components, the gauntlet and the palm, in a total print time of under 8 hours. Now the prothetic was ready to assemble. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">The prosthetic took around one hour to assemble from all of the finished components and the E-NABLE kit. First, the fingers and knuckles were connected to the palm of the prosthetic using the pins which were printed along with the other components. Next, the gauntlet was attached to the bottom of the palm using the remaining pins and washers and the tensioner was attached to the gauntlet. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">After, mobility had to be added to the prosthetic using rubber bands and string. Rubber bands were attached to hooks between the finger and knuckle sections to allow the fingers to return to an upright position after bending. Next, strings were run through the holes within the palm and looped through the tension pins where they were eventually tied to sections in the fingerprint areas on each finger. Finally, the tension pins were tightened using screws until the strings were taught which allowed for the fingers to curl up when the palm was moved down.  </p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">For the final portion of this project, we had to design a modification for the E-NABLE prosthetic which would make an activity easier to do. I decided to focus on designing a modification that allowed for home activities requiring fine motor skills to be accomplished with less effort, especially for individuals who need more than one prosthetic. To start, I drew a rough sketch of how I planned to approach this which is pictured above. I finalized on a design where extensions could be snapped on and removed from the fingers which include tools of varying functionality</p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">Before I could design the different types of tools, I had to determine a mechanism which would allow for the extensions to connect to the fingers. I decided to accomplish this in Fusion360; first I imported the STL file of the finger pieces and converted them from meshes into solid objects. Next, I used the dimensions of the fingers to hollow out cylindrical objects which would serve as the body of the extensions. The finger models were sized up by five percent to create a hole in the cylinders which were slightly larger than than fingers themselves. This would allow them to fit tight yet comfortably on the rubber guards at the ends of the finger on the E-NABLE prosthetic.    </p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">Finally, I moved to TinkerCAD to design ideas for different tool attachments that have the potential to improve home life. The first attachment I designed was a spoon that would make eating easier since small objects are difficult to grasp and manipulate with the E-NABLE hand. The second attachment I designed was a holder for writing utensils with similar reasoning as the previous design in mind. The last attachment I designed was a stylus that can operate a touchscreen smartphone. Since the plastic fingers of the E-NABLE prosthetic do not register on touchscreens, the stylus would add that functionality. These designs are still a bit basic in their appearance, but they will serve as groundwork upon which further improvements can be made. While I am satisfied with the outcome of this project, if I had additional time to work on it I would have refined the designs of these extensions and attachments to make them more appealing and functional. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">Our team began by designing hardware that could be applied directly to a hospital bed and interface with ostomy equipment. We had decided that clips or clamps would be the best start for anchoring polyethylene drainage tubes and preventing kinking. For our first design sketch, we planned to fabricate long PLA clips that would hold the drainage tubes and attach to the hospital bed via either magnets or velcro. This would allow the tubes to remain untangled and firmly attached to the hospital bed, but also allow them to be easily detached in the event of an emergency. We also proposed the idea of securing the drainage container to further prevent tangling but this will be addressed in a future update.    </p>

                                    <!-- Portfolio Modal - Text-->
                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">Next, we drafted an alternative design in which we used smaller tube clips and committed to velcro-based securing. Additionally, this design had the clips attached parrallel with the bed rail rather than the side frame. In both of these deisgns, our measure for success would depend upon if the drainage tubing remained unkinked and the rate of liquid flow through the tubing. This method to assess these measures will be implemented at a later date in the interest of time, but it is important to keep these metrics in mind while designing our potential solutions.  </p>

It was decided that my role would mainly be focused on refining the product designs and recreating the sketches in CAD software. For my first individual task, I had designed different clip applications in Fusion360. The image above depicts one of the longer clip iterations in Fusion360 with an internal diameter significantly larger than the drainage tube.  </p>

First, we decided to 3D print multiple hose clamps of varying sizes on prusa slicer. These clamps were very resource efficient and only took around 23 minutes to print completely. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">Next, we attempted to print varying sizes of adjustable rotating clamps. While we were interested in the mechanics of this design, there were a few glaring issues. First, the space inside of the clamp was very open and not really accomodating to the drainage tubing. Next, these clamps had used a large quantity of PLA filament compared to the hose clamps and had a total print time of 2 hours and 46 minutes. Finally, the adjustable clamps had failed during their print cycle and this was the last straw for this design. Given all of these observations, we decided not to pursue this design.  </p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">After, we began to print clips that were based on our design sketches. In this iteration, we printed small, short clips which had small indentations for magnets to be secured. We also had printed attachment points for these clips to be secured to the bed frame (containing magnets of the opposite polarity). Like the hose clamps, these clips were very resource efficient and only took 26 minutes to print.  </p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">The final type of design that we had decided to print from our sketch was the long tube clip. This design, while more resource and time intensive than the shorter iteration, requires fewer units and maintains a larger point of contact with the drainage tube which prevents kinking over longer distances. One section of the long clip took 49 minutes to print without the attachment points.  </p>

Despite this, the locking mechanisms were dysfunctional and were very difficult to open and close. Additionally, the circular shape of the clamp made it difficult to determine an effective method of attachment. Due to these reasons, it was determined by our group that this design would not prove effective.  </p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">Both of these clips are based off of our two previously designed iterations: the long clip and short clip. These clips have smaller diameters and should fit tightly around the polyethylene drainage tubes. The shorter clips should be able to adhere to the bed rail while the longer clips should adhere along the side of the bed frame using either velcro or magnets. A concern of using this design is that the clips will secure too tightly around the drainage tubing, ultimately restricting the flow. However, this is something we will work to prevent and otherwise these are our most promising designs so far.    </p>

                                    <p class="mb-20 text-secondary">These two designs are both remixes of the short and long clips, being much larger in diameter. These clips were designed as a direct result of the potential risk of the smaller iterations in restricting flow. Despite this, we would conisder these designs to be more effective than the hose clamps yet less effective than the smaller clips. While the larger size does eliminate the pressure risk, it does not secure the drainage tubing as effectively and thus does not reduce the risk of kinking to the same degree. These clips would operate much better in securing tubes with larger diameters, and may still be able to provide functionality for ostomy patients.  </p>
